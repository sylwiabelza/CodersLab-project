# CodersLab-project

Project created as a result of programming boot-camp. This project is evolving each day. It's about weather conditions in different ski resorts in Poland. In the future I want it to contain height of snow cover, humidity and many more.

Idea is to use REACT as a main tool, and thanks to that save resources and time. Moreover that should help author to see his own progress ;) Project contains : REACT, SASS, JSX, GRID, WEBPACK and FETCH.
