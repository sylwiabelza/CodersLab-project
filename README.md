# CodersLab-project
Project created in the end of programing bootcamp 

This project is evolving each day. It's about weather conditions in different ski resorts in Poland. In the future I want it to contains height of snow cover, humidity and many others. 

Idea is to use REACT as a main tool, and thanks to that save resources and time. Plus helps creator to see his own progress :) Project contains : REACT, SASS, JSX, GRID, WEBPACK and FETCH is during preparations.
